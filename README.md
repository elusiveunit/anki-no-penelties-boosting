# No penalties or boosting

Part of [Low-Key Anki from MIA](https://massimmersionapproach.com/table-of-contents/anki/low-key-anki/low-key-anki-summary-and-installation/), which itself credits ja-dark and [eshapard.github.io](https://eshapard.github.io/). This is the same idea as MIA's 2.1 version but uses Anki's new hook system added in 2.1.20 and works with the new scheduler.
